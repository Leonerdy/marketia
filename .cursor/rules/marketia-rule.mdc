1. Semantic and Well-Organized Structure
Use semantic HTML tags: <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>.

Follow proper heading hierarchy (<h1>, <h2>, etc.).

Separate concerns using reusable components (e.g., HeroSection, Features, Testimonials).

2. Performance & SEO
Use Static Site Generation (SSG) with Next.js for pre-rendering.

Add proper metadata using <meta>, <title> inside next/head for SEO.

Use next/image for optimized image loading and lazy loading support.

3. Accessibility
Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.

Add alt attributes to all images.

Use aria-label for navigation links and buttons where necessary.

4. Design & UX
Build a Hero Section with a strong headline, supporting subtext, and a clear CTA (e.g., “Start Free Trial”).

Suggested sections:

The problem your SaaS solves.

The AI-powered solution: how AI helps supermarkets.

Direct benefits: decision-making, profit growth, waste reduction.

Testimonials or real-life use cases.

Call to Action (e.g., contact button, interest form).

Mobile-first design from the beginning (responsive layout).

5. Technologies
Use Next.js + TailwindCSS (consider ShadCN UI for professional design components).

Deploy for free using Vercel with custom domain support.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies to keep the bundle size light.

6. Components & Best Practices
Store components in components/ folder.

Use utility-first CSS with Tailwind (or CSS Modules if needed).

Only use useEffect and useState for interactive features (e.g., scroll events, animations).

Use TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.

7. Extra Best Practices
Integrate Google Analytics (or an alternative) for visitor tracking.

Include a simple form (e.g., email capture) with basic validation.


Provide visual feedback for interactions (e.g., buttons, forms, hover effects).
